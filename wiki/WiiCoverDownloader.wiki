*INFO*
 * All covers will downloaded from gametdb.com

*REQUIREMENTS*
 * PC with .NET 2.0 installed
 * Your devices with games and loader connected to your PC

*HOW TO USE*
 * Start the program
 * Select the device where there are the Loader (are supported USB Loader GX, Wiiflow and Configurable USB Loader).
 * The application automatically check which Loader are present in the selected device
 * Now select the device where are stored your games.
 * Then start the Download and wait. (LOL)
 * The application will download the images and then put in the correct folder for each Loader detected.

*CUSTOMIZATION*
 * If you want to change the language, go to "Language preferences" and change it.
 * In case you have already modified/customized paths for covers in Loader settings, change them also in this application: "Loader Path Preferences".
 * You can see the used paths for games (Wii games, Gamecube and Emulated Nand) in the "Device Path Preferences". If necessary change them according to your needs.

*HOW THE APPLICATION SEARCH GAMES IN DEVICE*
 * For Wii games, simply search .wbfs files. They have the ID directly in the name (es: SC7I52.wbfs = Call of Duty: Black Ops). If you haven't the ID as name of wbfs files, application can't download images. If you are using a WBFS partition.. no problem: I'll read it with wbfs_file.exe .
 * For Game Cube Games, I supposed that them are in DIOS MIOS 'format' (es: games\GLMP01\game.iso = Luigi's Mansion). If you haven't games in the folder with ID, application can't download images.
 * For emulated NAND channel, I simply read folder name, for take ID of channels.
